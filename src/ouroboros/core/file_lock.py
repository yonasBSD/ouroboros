"""Cross-platform file locking utilities.

Replaces Unix-only fcntl.flock() with filelock for Windows compatibility.
Provides the same context manager API used throughout the codebase.

The filelock library uses OS-level locking (fcntl on Unix, msvcrt on Windows)
with automatic fallback. Lock files are created alongside the target file
with a .lock extension.
